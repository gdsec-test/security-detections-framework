# Alerts

## Detections

The detections directory is where all the alert detections are stored. Detections are
organized by platform. If there is not a directory for the platform that you are writing
an detection for, then ask a Threat Research team member on the correct format to use.

## Examples

The examples directory contains examples of how to write alerts for the various platforms.
These are not meant to be actionable alerts. Real, production-ready alerts need to be placed
in the detections directory.

## Templates

The templates directory contains boilerplate code that can be copy and pasted to start a new alert.
It includes the JSON metadata file template that is required of all alerts.
