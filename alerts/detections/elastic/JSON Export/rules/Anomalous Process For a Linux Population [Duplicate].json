Is this program part of an expected workflow for the user who ran this program on this host?\n- Examine the history of execution. If this process manifested only very recently, it might be part of a new software package. If it has a consistent cadence - for example if it runs monthly or quarterly - it might be part of a monthly or quarterly business process.\n- Examine the process arguments, title and working directory.
