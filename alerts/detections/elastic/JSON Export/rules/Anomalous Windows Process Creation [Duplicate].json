Malicious scripts often call on other applications and processes as part of their exploit payload. For example, when a malicious Office document runs scripts as part of an exploit payload, Excel or Word may start a script interpreter process, which, in turn, runs a script that downloads and executes malware. Another common scenario is Outlook running an unusual process when malware is downloaded in an email. Monitoring and identifying anomalous process relationships is a method of detecting new and emerging malware that is not yet recognized by anti-virus scanners.","risk_score":21,"severity":"low","license":"Elastic License v2","output_index":".siem-signals-default","author":["Elastic"],"false_positives":["Users running scripts in the course of technical support operations of software upgrades could trigger this alert.
