A process with unusual network activity can denote process exploitation or injection, where the process is used to run persistence mechanisms that allow a malicious actor remote access or control of the host, data exfiltration, and execution of unauthorized network applications.","risk_score":21,"severity":"low","note":"### Investigating Unusual Network Activity ###\nDetection alerts from this rule indicate the presence of network activity from a Linux process for which network activity is rare and unusual.  Here are some possible avenues of investigation:\n- Consider the IP addresses and ports. Are these used by normal but infrequent network workflows? Are they expected or unexpected?\n- If the destination IP address is remote or external, does it associate with an expected domain, organization or geography? Note: avoid interacting directly with suspected malicious IP addresses.\n- Consider the user as identified by the username field. Is this network activity part of an expected workflow for the user who ran the program?\n- Examine the history of execution. If this process manifested only very recently, it might be part of a new software package. If it has a consistent cadence - for example if it runs monthly or quarterly - it might be part of a monthly or quarterly business or maintenance process.\n- Examine the process arguments, title and working directory. These may provide indications as to the source of the program or the nature of the tasks it is performing.","license":"Elastic License v2","output_index":".siem-signals-default","author":["Elastic"],"false_positives":[],"from":"now-45m","rule_id":"c0cab95a-6f37-4344-8840-2fa989995a0a","max_signals":100,"risk_score_mapping":[],"severity_mapping":[],"threat":[],"to":"now","references":["https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/prebuilt-ml-jobs.html"],"version":4,"exceptions_list":[],"immutable":false,"type":"machine_learning","anomaly_threshold":50,"machine_learning_job_id":["linux_anomalous_network_activity_ecs"],"throttle":"no_actions","actions":[]}
