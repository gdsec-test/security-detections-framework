Are they expected or unexpected?\n- If the destination IP address is remote or external, does it associate with an expected domain, organization or geography? Note: avoid interacting directly with suspected malicious IP addresses.\n- Consider the user as identified by the username field. Is this network activity part of an expected workflow for the user who ran the program?\n- Examine the history of execution.

Examine the user identity in the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` field and the access key id in the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` field which can help identify the precise user context. The user agent details in the `user_agent.original` field may also indicate what kind of a client made the request.\n- Consider the source IP address and geolocation for the calling user who issued the command. Do they look normal for the calling user? If the source is an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your accounts or could it be sourcing from an EC2 instance not under your control? If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of suspicious activity involving this instance?\n- Consider the time of day. If the user is a human, not a program or script, did the activity take place during a normal time of day?\n- Examine the history of the command. If the command, which is visible in the `event.action field`, manifested only very recently, it might be part of a new automation module or script. If it has a consistent cadence - for example, if it appears in small numbers on a weekly or monthly cadence it might be part of a housekeeping or maintenance process.\n- Examine the request parameters.
