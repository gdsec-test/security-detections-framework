## Purpose

* This document describes the Governance Model for a Governance Committee to provide decisioning and approval for changes
made to the Security Detections Framework

## Definitions

- **Detection**
  - Any rule within an alerting platform which is used to detect specific activities.
  - Example: When a login attempt occurs, a rule detects if it is authorized or not.
- **Alert**
  - Any detection which has been configured to notify a defined individual, group, team, etc.
  - Example: When an unauthorized login is detected, an alert notifies the account owner.
- **Detection Repository**
  - A location which stores details about configured detections.

## Scope

* This repo is intended to list any detections which Godaddy is direcly responsible for maintaining. Third party detections which are maintained by the external entity do not need to be added to this repo unless there is a modification, required internal support, or specific knowledge that needs to be documented for other teams. 


## Governance Roles/Responsibilities

* Observers, Detection Creators, Detection Owners, and Governance Committee. 
* Access to any of these roles can be granted by creating a PR to add themselves to the corelating group. PR request are subject to approval by a member of the Governance Committee

### Observers

A member of the Security Detections Framework with read only access. 

### Detection Creators
* listed as a knowledge resource containing information regarding the origin of the alert. Not responsible for ongoing maintenance of the alert, but may remain an important asset in modifying the alert in the future.

### Detection Owners

* Detection Owners are responsible for validating the detection folder contains a file with complete [Meta Data](https://github.com/gdcorp-infosec/security-detections-framework/tree/main/alerts/detections#metadata), and follows the proper [Naming Schema](https://github.com/gdcorp-infosec/security-detections-framework/tree/main/alerts/detections#naming)

* Detection owners are also responsible for maintaning Testing data following the Testing guidelines

* Detection owners are not necessarily the detection creator, there are a number of scenarios in which a detection may be created by another team in support of a joint effort and ownership assigned to the owning authority.  (i.e. A detection request was sent to Threat-Research by the IR team while responding to an incident, the Threat-Research team would quickly create the alert, but ownership would remain with IR.)


## Governance Committee

As the framework goes into continued use cycles, the Governance Committee will need to conduct quarterly reviews to validate that rules are operational, testing is recent and relevant, and rule ownership is properly assigned.

The Governance Committee allow approves/rejects changes to any Detection Framework process, and governance.

A [Governance Committee private slack channel] will be available to the Committee

### Governance Committee Membership
